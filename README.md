# Vanguard Beacon SwiftUI clone

## About
A mockup clone of Vanguard's Becon app using SwifUI

I wanted to see if I can mockup/recreate parts of the Vanguard app using SwiftUI. Another reason is Beacon doesn't have dark mode, so I wanted to see how that would look like. 

All the UI was made using the iPhone XS Max, so some componenets maybe not look nice unless it's on it.
