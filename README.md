# Vanguard Beacon SwiftUI clone

## About
A mockup clone of Vanguard's Becon app using SwifUI

I wanted to see if I can mockup/recreate parts of the Vanguard app using SwiftUI. Another reason is Beacon doesn't have dark mode, so I wanted to see how that would look like. 

All the UI was made using the iPhone XS Max, so some components maybe not look nice unless it's on it.

This is a mockup, all data is faked and there are no network calls.

Everything was designed/created without usaged of any Vanguard related media. All symbols/font are system defaults of iOS.
